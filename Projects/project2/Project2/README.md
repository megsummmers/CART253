# Template p5 project

Welcome to Dungeon Quest!
I wanted this game to be a fun but still somewhat challenging game about exploring dungeons and mazes. I personally love maze games so I thought making one for this project would be something I could get excited and passionate about. I was also able to include my other hobby, art, through the cutscenes and prize art.
The goal of the game itself is to be challenging enough that it keeps your attention but also relaxing so your not constantly scared or pressured while playing. The game is made to accommodate different playing styles as you can achieve the main goal of the game (buying a soda) without actually playing through the entire thing. This means that there are many challenges and secrets for those who like to complete games to 100% but it can also be played casually for those who just want to run through it quickly.
For example, casual players might go through all 5 levels but not collect every coin or might not kill any spiders, while completionist can aim to kill every spider ad get both secret endings.
