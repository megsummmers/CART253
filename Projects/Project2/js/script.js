Dungeon Quest:
A dungeon adventure game where you go to explore a Dungeon

and get out with your loot. If you find a bow and arrow
you can kill the spiders by shooting them.

Try to add:
-Boss level, giant spider with more health and/or timer
-Storyline/animation for opening
-Add more dungeon levels
-Go down to the lowest level then have to come back up

Prototype Checklist:
-Transfer to Prototype
-adjust map and spider distance to make it more difficult
